    "summary": "Software engineering is the application of principles used in engineering design, development,testing, deployment, and management of software systems. One of the software engineering’s approaches,highly used in new industries, is agile development. User stories are a commonly used notation to captureuser requirements in agile development. Nevertheless, for the elaboration of user stories, a high levelof collaboration with the client is necessary. This professional skill is rarely measured or evaluated ineducational contexts. The present work approaches collaboration in software engineering students throughmultimodal learning analytics, modeling, and evaluating students’ collaboration while they are writing userstories. For that, we used multidirectional microphones in order to derive social network analysis metricsrelated to collaboration (permanence and prompting) together with human-annotated information (qualityof the stories and productivity). Results show that groups with a lower productivity in writing user storiesand less professional experience in managing software requirements present a non-collaborative behaviormore frequently, and that teams with a fewer number of interventions are more likely to produce a greaternumber of user stories. Moreover, although low experience subjects produced more user stories, a greaterproductivity of the most experienced subjects was not statistically veriﬁed. We believe that these types of initiatives will allow the measurement and early development of such skills in university students"
